Your browser by default is equivalent to garbage, it probably doesn't block many of the privacy and security invading things like ads and trackers by default. Here's a list of some useful browser extensions that you might wanna add to your browser

## uBlock Origin

![uBlock-Origin](/pictures/browser-extensions/uBlock-Origin.jpeg)

### Downloads

Chrome- https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?  
Firefox- https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/

### Function

The uBlock Origin is a free and open-source, cross-platform browser extension for content filtering—primarily aimed at neutralizing privacy invasion in an efficient, user-friendly method. uBlock Origin is not just an “ad blocker“, it's a wide-spectrum content blocker with CPU and memory efficiency as a primary feature.

### Why should you use it?

uBlock Origin blocks ads from interrupting you whenever you are browsing the internet, watching a YouTube video or streaming Twitch livestreams, it is mainly useful while visiting "shady" websites because those websites primarily are very heavy on the ads, turning them off will probably save you from not clicking the wrong "download" button.  
There's also the added security benefit, there are some ads which can inject malware/spyware into your browser upon clicking them and uBlock Origin protects you from it because it never appears on your screen, therefore.. zero chance of getting infected through ads.

### Downloads

Chrome- https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/localcdn/njdfdhgcmkocbgbhcioffdbicglldapd?hl=en-US  
Firefox- https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/localcdn-fork-of-decentraleyes/

### Function

Protects you against tracking through "free", centralized, content delivery. It prevents a lot of requests from reaching networks like Google Hosted Libraries, and serves local files to keep sites from breaking. Complements regular content blockers.

### Why should you use it?

Being able to not connect to a lot of Google Hosted Libraries will mainly protect you from Google tracking, this can also help improve the web experience, faster loading times and minimal buffering in videos.

**Note: LocalCDN is no silver bullet, but it does prevent a lot of websites from making you send these kinds of requests. Ultimately, you can make LocalCDN block requests for any missing CDN resources, too.**
