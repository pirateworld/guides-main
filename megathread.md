### Required Components and Debloating Utilities for Maximum Performance and Compatibility

- [DirectX](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35)
- [VisualCPPRedist AIO](https://github.com/abbodi1406/vcredist/releases/latest)
- [XNA Framework](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914)
- [Chris Titus Tech Windows Utility](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil)
	- Run the following command in an administrative powershell window: `iwr -useb https://christitus.com/win | iex`
- [BloatyNosy](https://github.com/builtbybel/BloatyNosy)
- [BulkCrapUninstaller](https://www.bcuninstaller.com)
- [BleachBit](https://www.bleachbit.org)

Side note: Kinda funny how in order to debloat Windows, you have to add **more** bloat.

### Torrent Sites:

**Note: A VPN is highly recommended, you might get a letter from your ISP if you torrent without a VPN**  

Visit [this section of the qBittorrent guide to understand why](https://gitlab.com/ZediAlreadyTaken/guides/-/blob/main/qbittorrent.md#why-is-this-important)

- [1337x](https://1337x.to) - Avoid torrents uploaded by IGG Games. See here [why](#please-do-not-use-igg-games).
- [Mac Torrents](https://mac-torrents.io/mac-games)
- [RARBG](https://rarbg.to)
- [Rutor](http://www.rutor.info)
- [RuTracker](https://rutracker.org)
- [Rustorka](http://rustorka.com)
- [Tapochek](https://tapochek.net/index.php)

### Direct Download Sites:

**Note: A VPN is not required for Direct Downloads**

Directly downloading something means you're just downloading it normally like you always do i.e. using a web browser such as Firefox or Chrome. These are generally the safest form of downloading pirated content since the only entitites that could know you're downloading are the site provider themselves and your ISP. In most cases, your ISP will not care,

It is highly recommended to use a Download Manager such as JDownloader2 for using these websites, visit the [JDownloader2 Guide](https://gitlab.com/ZediAlreadyTaken/guides/-/blob/main/jdownloader2.md) to learn more.

### Untrusted sites/uploaders:

**The Pirate Bay/TPB:** Do not use the pirate bay or any of its mirrors to download games/software. High malware risk, even from skulled users  
**Kickass Torrents/KAT:** Kat went down in 2016. Don't rely on any supposed mirrors floating around.  
**BBRepacks:** BlackBox Repacks impersonator. Malware in the Doom Eternal repack posted on TPB and 1337x  
**Qoob/Seyter:** Qoob is the name that Seyter switched to after having been caught adding a bitcoin miner to his JC3 repack. More info on Qoob  
**CorePack:** Malware in a long list of their releases. Some background. Their official statement  
**Ocean Of Games:** Malware risk and past history of coin miners included in their installers  
**NosTEAM:** Shitty blog site with shoddy ads. Torrent downloads are handled by an intermediary ~3 MiB executable file: the epitome of shady behavior.  
**igg-games.com / pcgamestorrents.com / gamestorrent.co:** 

# Please do not use IGG Games

1. Ads built into the game at runtime: <https://i.redd.it/x1gz0rbix1721.jpg>
2. DRM added to their releases which prevents the game from launching if removed: <https://i.imgur.com/pNjo10d.png>
3. Cryptominers and startup malware included in their games: <https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/bzczk6/i_think_i_found_an_infected_game_on_igggamescom/eqsqqj0/>
4. Attempting to install browser hijackers: <https://www.unddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/apcvx4/deleted_by_user/>
5. Javascript malware on their website: <https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/9f1rf2/igg_games_now_downloads_adware_into_your_computer/>
6. Bad behaviour from site owners: <https://web.archive.org/web/20220305120030/https://reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/apcvx4/here_we_go_again_igg_this_time_im_not_reporting/>

Any website using the name of a Scene group (such as CODEX, CPY, SKIDROW, HOODLUM, RELOADED, SiMPLEX, DARKSiDERS, PLAZA, etc.).  
Scene groups do not have public websites. If you find a site using the name of a scene group, they are impersonators.  
Beware of these sites as they tend to package their releases with malware.

Any site you find on Google by searching for "free game downloads", "cracked games", etc.  
Google de-lists piracy websites from its search results, which means that fake/impostor/malware-spreading sites will float to the top of the search results.

Any "cracked games" site or download you find on Youtube

Any aggregator site like snowfl or DHT crawler like btdb, btdig, etc. Not because the sites intend to infect you with malware, but because their intent is to aggregate as many publicly available torrents as possible into one place. This can include torrents that have been posted to TPB or otherwise spread publicly via the DHT network. You should only grab games from sites that take a personal hand in adding content (excludes sites that auto-post scene releases, in which case they would need to be vetted to make sure that their posts are real scene releases) rather than automatically aggregating from hundreds of unknown sites.
