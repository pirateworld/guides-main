# CONSOLE TIPS AND TRICKS

**Question 1: How do I Jailbreak my Console?**  
**Answer 1: Usually, you will get a lot of results if you just search for the term "{Console Name Here} Hacking".**

For example: <https://www.reddit.com/r/VitaPiracy/> and <https://vita.hacks.guide/>

**Question 2: I don't have a console but I want to play some console games on my PC, can I do that?**  
**Answer 2: Yes, but with a few hiccups, you'll need to find the ROM and plug it into a suitable emulator, performance of the game is not guaranteed.**
